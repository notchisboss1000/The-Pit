  <p><em>The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game.</em>
  <br>
  The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen.
  <br>
  This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac.
  <br>
  The main game is split up into two areas
  <br>
  <strong>Rogue Rooms</strong> and <strong>Build Rooms</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>Room Types</h2>
  <p><strong>Rogue Rooms</strong>
  <br>
  &gt; Rogue Rooms are typical top-down Zelda-style rooms with enemies and such.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Build Rooms</strong>
  <br>
  &gt; Build Rooms are 2d Terraria style rooms where there is a parkour area or a puzzle.
  <br>
  &gt; In these rooms, your weapon turns into a digging tool based on its attributes, and you gain a block inventory.
  </p>
  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>Currently, there are 8 characters (and 2 variants);
  <br>
  Missingno., Paradigm, Cuddles, The Tattered, Gravita, Amnesiac, Ember, Sam
  <br>
  Each character has its own stats and unique abilities.
  </p>
  <p>Sam
  <br>
  &gt; Literally does nothing special
  </p>
  <p>Ember
  <br>
  &gt; Spits fire and can summon fire tornadoes
  </p>
  <p>Amnesiac
  <br>
  &gt; Rerolls his stats and items
  </p>
  <p>Gravita
  <br>
  &gt; Bends gravity to his will
  </p>
  <p>Cuddles
  <br>
  &gt; Deals out deadly contact damage and takes none back
  </p>
  <p>Cuddles II
  <br>
  &gt; Deals MASSIVE contact damage BUT takes some back
  </p>
  <p>The Tattered
  <br>
  &gt; Can't regen but starts with max hp
  </p>
  <p>Paradigm
  <br>
  &gt; Can Phase through the world
  </p>
  <p>Missingno.
  <br>
  &gt; Random everything
  </p>
