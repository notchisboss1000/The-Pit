  <p><em>The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game. A demo is planned to be released soon.</em>
  <br>
  The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen.
  <br>
  This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac.
  <br>
  The main game is split up into two areas
  <br>
  <strong>Rogue Rooms</strong> and <strong>Build Rooms</strong>
  </p>
  <h2>Room Types</h2>
  <p><strong>Rogue Rooms</strong>
  <br>
  &gt; Rogue Rooms are typical top-down Zelda-style rooms with enemies and such.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Build Rooms</strong>
  <br>
  &gt; Build Rooms are 2d Terraria style rooms where there is a parkour area or a puzzle.
  <br>
  &gt; In these rooms, your weapon turns into a digging tool based on its attributes, and you gain a block inventory.
  </p>
  <h2><a href="https://notchisboss1000.github.io/The-Pit/?data=characters">Characters</a></h2>
  <p> Currently, there are 8  <a href="https://notchisboss1000.github.io/The-Pit/?data=characters">characters</a> (and 2 variants);
  <br>
  Missingno., Paradigm, Cuddles, The Tattered, Gravita, Amnesiac, Ember, Sam
  <br>
  Each character has its own stats and unique abilities.
  </p>
  <p>Sam
  <br>
  &gt; Literally does nothing special
  </p>
  <p>Ember
  <br>
  &gt; Spits fire and can summon fire tornadoes
  </p>
  <p>Amnesiac
  <br>
  &gt; Rerolls his stats and items
  </p>
  <p>Gravita
  <br>
  &gt; Bends gravity to his will
  </p>
  <p>Cuddles
  <br>
  &gt; Deals out deadly contact damage and takes none back
  </p>
  <p>Cuddles II
  <br>
  &gt; Deals MASSIVE contact damage BUT takes some back
  </p>
  <p>The Tattered
  <br>
  &gt; Can't regen but starts with max hp
  </p>
  <p>Paradigm
  <br>
  &gt; Can Phase through the world
  </p>
  <p>Missingno.
  <br>
  &gt; Random everything
  </p>

Ember is unlocked by beating hard mode. <br>

He starts out in a Straw costume of a human, where he can hold items, but cannot fly. In this phase he can use a weak, lesser version of his fire breath. <br>

After taking enough damage, the costume breaks off unveiling his true dragon form. In this form he trades his ability to hold weapons, for an increased fire breath, a wing swipe attack, fire tornadoes, and flight. <br>

Amnesiac is unlocked by deleting your save file. (Or unlocking all others) <br>
Amnesiac has lost his sight and his memory and tends to “forget” stuff. <br>
On the change to a new level, he may <br>
- Forget some of his items/Misremember them <br>
- Forget a Core game mechanic, like starting to walk invertedly <br>
- Gets confused and May have different HP moving to the next floor <br>
- Forget how to breathe (1/50 on level change) and have to press [P] to breathe for the rest of the floor <br>
<br>
To compensate for his lack of memory, his damage is MASSIVE <br>
---------------------- <br>
<h3>Gravita</h3>
Unlocked by beating a boss with The Black Hole <br>
Attempting to move with [WASD] will bend gravity<br>
Gravita starts with Black Hole as his weapon instead of an active. He can throw it with [↤↕↦] like any passive weapon.<br>

        <p> <h3>This is where I put my ideas on how the game should feel.</h3>
	<b>Non-permadeath:</b> When a run ends, there will be other things to do other than starting a new run </br>
 																		<b>Hellrun;</b> When you die, you have to race back through the level to the starting room, reaching the starting room will bring you back 1 level until you reach the first room. </br>
  	All enemies will become on fire; highly aggressive and unkillable. The doors in rooms will not close and it becomes a race to the finish. </br>
	<b>Final Plight;</b> A colosseum-style fight-to-the-death that continually gets harder until you die again </br>
 	When you inevitably lose the match, it unlocks <a href="https://notchisboss1000.github.io/The-Pit/?data=colliseum-mode">Coliseum Mode and Endless Coliseum Mode<a>. </br>
  	<b>Soul Plane;</b> Dying unlocks a new aspect in the soul plane. </br>
