*The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game.* <br/>
The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen. <br/>
This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac. <br/>
The main game is split up into two areas <br/>
**Rogue Rooms** and **Build Rooms** <br/>

## Room Types    
  **Rogue Rooms** <br/>
  > Rogue Rooms are typical top-down Zelda-style rooms with enemies and such. <br/>
  
  **Build Rooms** <br/>
  > Build Rooms are 2d Terraria style rooms where there is a parkour area or a puzzle. <br/>
  > In these rooms, your weapon turns into a digging tool based on its attributes, and you gain a block inventory. <br>
  
## Characters

Currently, there are 8 characters (and 2 variants); <br>
Missingno., Paradigm, Cuddles, The Tattered, Gravita, Amnesiac, Ember, Sam <br/>
Each character has its own stats and unique abilities. <br>

Sam <br>
> Literally does nothing special <br>

Ember <br>
> Spits fire and can summon fire tornadoes <br>

Amnesiac <br>
> Rerolls his stats and items <br>

Gravita <br>
> Bends gravity to his will <br>

Cuddles <br>
> Deals out deadly contact damage and takes none back <br>

Cuddles II <br>

> Deals MASSIVE contact damage BUT takes some back <br>


The Tattered <br>
> Can't regen but starts with max hp <br>

Paradigm <br>
> Can Phase through the world <br>

Missingno. <br>
> Random everything <br>
