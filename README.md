The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game. <br/>
The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen. <br/>
This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac. <br/>
The main game is split up into two areas <br/>
- Rogue Rooms <br/>
and <br/>
- Build Rooms <br/>
