The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game. <dr/>
The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen. <dr/>
This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac. <dr/>
The main game is split up into two areas <dr/>
- Rogue Rooms <dr/>
and <dr/>
- Build Rooms <dr/>
