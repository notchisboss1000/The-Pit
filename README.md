*The Pit is a game concept currently, not yet a fleshed-out game.* <br/>
The Pit is a platformer-roguelike where you play in the mind of an overimaginative teen. <br/>
This game incorporates many aspects from my favorite games such as Terraria and The Binding of Isaac. <br/>
The main game is split up into two areas <br/>
**Rogue Rooms** and **Build Rooms** <br/>

<details>
<summary>Room Types</summary>
    
  ### Rogue Rooms <br/>
  > Rogue Rooms are typical top-down Zelda-style rooms with enemies and such. <br/>
  
  ### Build Rooms <br/>
  >> Build Rooms are 2d Terraria style rooms where there is a parkour area or a puzzle. <br/>
  > In these rooms, your weapon turns into a digging tool based on its attributes, and you gain a block inventory. <br>
  
### Characters <br>
  </details>

Currently, there are 8 characters (and 2 variants); <br>
